There is a provided a pointing device, for example a remote pen which includes a multimode switch or button for transitioning the pointing device between three or more modes of operation. The mode of operation can include a first mode, an annotation mode and an air mouse mode. The remote point device further includes an inertial measurement unit configured for determination orientation information associated with the pointing device, which provides a means for determination of changes in x and y with respect to a cursor associated with a screen of a display device being controlled by the pointing device. The pointing device is further configured to provide different control/display (C/D) gains depending on the action being performed by the pointing device.
