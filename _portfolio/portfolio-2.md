We performed a user study that compared the efficiency and accuracy of different input methods (mouse, hand-tracking, and trackpad) for 3D positioning tasks with the HTC Vive. The results showed that the mouse outperformed hand-tracking and the trackpad, in terms of efficiency and accuracy. For situations where the user is seated in immersive VR, the mouse is thus still the best input device for precise 3D positioning.
