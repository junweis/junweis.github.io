A method is provided including generating touch coordinate information corresponding to touch interactions with a touchscreen display of an electronic device and updating information rendered on the touchscreen display in response to determining that the touch coordinate information matches a tool shaft movement gesture corresponding to movement of a touch tool shaft over an area of the touchscreen display. A device is provided, including a touchscreen display comprising a display and a touch sensing system configured to generate signals corresponding to screen touches of the display, a processing device operatively coupled to the touchscreen display, and a non-transitory memory coupled to the processing device and storing software instructions that when executed by the processing device configure the processing device to carry out the provided method. The ability to process tool shaft gestures may improve one or both of the operation of the device and the user experience with the device.
