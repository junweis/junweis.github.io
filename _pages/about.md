I am a Human-Computer Interaction researcher at Huawei HMI Lab. I work on novel interaction technologies that enhance people's daily life. My current projects involve wearable devices and spatial interaction.

I was born in Tianjin, China. I obtained a B.Sc. in Intelligence Science and Technology at Peking University and an M.Sc. in Computer Vision from Western University. My master's thesis was about image classification using machine learning techniques. I completed a Ph.D. at SIAT, Simon Fraser University under Dr. Wolfgang Stuerzlinger's supervision. My doctoral dissertation was about 3D user interface and virtual reality. Outside of research, I have worked as a teaching assistant, instructor, and tutor.
