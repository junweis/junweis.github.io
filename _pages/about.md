I am a researcher specializing in Human-Computer Interaction at the Ningbo Institute of Digital Twin, Eastern Institute of Technology, where I focus on collaborating with companies to address real-world problems using VR and HCI technologies.

I was born in Tianjin, China, and pursued a B.Sc. in Intelligence Science and Technology at Peking University. I later earned an M.Sc. in Computer Vision from Western University, with my master’s thesis exploring image classification through machine learning techniques. I completed my Ph.D. at Simon Fraser University’s SIAT under the mentorship of Dr. Wolfgang Stuerzlinger, with my research concentrating on 3D user interfaces and virtual reality.

In addition to my research, I have experience as a teaching assistant, instructor, and tutor, supporting and guiding students in various academic settings. I also worked as a sessional instructor at the University of Toronto, teaching an HCI course.
