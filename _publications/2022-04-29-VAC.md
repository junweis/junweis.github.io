This paper studies the vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) and its effect on 3D pointing in virtual reality. We build a multifocal stereo display, which can eliminate the influence of the VAC for pointing within the investigated distances. Our user study results show that the VAC influences 3D selection performance in common VR and AR stereo displays and that multifocal displays have a positive effect on 3D selection performance with a virtual hand.
