I am a researcher specializing in Human-Computer Interaction at Huawei’s HMI Lab, where I focus on developing cutting-edge interaction technologies. My current work involves cross-device interaction and Human-AI interaction.

I was born in Tianjin, China, and pursued a B.Sc. in Intelligence Science and Technology at Peking University. I later earned an M.Sc. in Computer Vision from Western University, with my master’s thesis exploring image classification through machine learning techniques. I completed my Ph.D. at Simon Fraser University’s SIAT under the mentorship of Dr. Wolfgang Stuerzlinger, with my research concentrating on 3D user interfaces and virtual reality.

In addition to my research, I have experience as a teaching assistant, instructor, and tutor, supporting and guiding students in various academic settings.
